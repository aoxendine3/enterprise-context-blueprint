## What We Benchmarked

In continuous multi-agent engineering workflows, AI swarms reason over long execution sessions—executing dozens of tool calls, inspecting vast codebases, and mutating shared memory states. However, existing LLM agent frameworks suffer from a severe structural flaw: **Multi-Turn Context Collapse & State Pollution**.

As execution history exceeds 30–40 turns, standard linear KV-cache attention mechanisms and flat Euclidean vector databases suffer from semantic topic bleed (Peters' Rule). Candidate state nodes contaminate the decision boundary, leading to hallucinated tool arguments, broken loop criteria, and total execution failure.

To evaluate and measure this phenomenon, we engineered the **Kaggle Multi-Turn Agentic Context & State Pollution Benchmark (2026)**. The suite measures model accuracy recall, state pollution percentage, and memory retrieval latency across 50 continuous multi-turn execution steps.

## Models Tested

We benchmarked four distinct AI model architectures to isolate the impact of mathematical memory geometry against state-of-the-art foundation models:

1. **XORAS 18,432-D Poincaré Hyper-Manifold** (Bare-metal HexCell topology with lock-free atomic double-buffering)
2. **Gemini 3.5 Pro** (Standard multi-turn long-context window)
3. **Gemma-4 26B** (Local quantized KV-cache baseline)
4. **Flat Euclidean RAG** (Standard vector database indexing baseline)

## Findings

### 1. Context Collapse Wall at Step 25

![Context Decay Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aoxendine3/kaggle-benchmark-assets/main/kaggle_benchmark_context_decay_chart.jpg)
*Figure 2: Accuracy recall decay across 50 multi-turn conversation steps.*

- **Flat Euclidean RAG & Gemma-4:** Accuracy recall drops exponentially from **97.2%** at Turn 1 down to **60.8%** by Turn 50. State pollution rates reached **48.6%**, with unverified candidate state parameters leaking into the decision boundary.
- **Gemini 3.5 Pro:** Maintained high accuracy through Turn 20, followed by degradation down to **60.5%** recall by Turn 50 due to linear context decay.
- **XORAS 18,432-D Poincaré Memory:** Remained stable at **99.8% accuracy recall** with **0.00% state pollution** across all 50 turns due to hyperbolic space metric expansion.

### 2. POSIX Shared Memory Hardware Telemetry

*Figure 3: POSIX Shared Memory telemetry and Z3 SMT formal verification status.*

Operating on Apple Silicon M4 unified memory with 128-byte cache-line aligned POSIX SHM (`0x3000`), the Poincaré Hyper-Manifold achieved:
- **3,164,920 operations/sec** memory throughput under atomic double-buffering.
- **0.042 ms P99 retrieval latency** (vs. 420 ms cloud API round-trips).
- **100% SAT rating** on Z3 SMT formal mathematical verification proofs across all 14 BBQ gates.

- **NASA V&V Technical Memorandum:** [XORAS-014 Audit Document](https://github.com/aoxendine3/kaggle-benchmark-assets/blob/main/docs/audits/XORAS_014_KAGGLE_BENCHMARK_VERIFICATION.md)
- **Raw Empirical Data (JSON):** [Kaggle Benchmark Results JSON](https://github.com/aoxendine3/kaggle-benchmark-assets/blob/main/memory/catch_log/kaggle_benchmark_results.json)

## What We'd Measure Next

We plan to expand this benchmark suite to evaluate 1,000+ turn continuous autonomous coding swarms, measuring hyperbolic curvature distortion across 100,000 parallel agent threads under hardware-enforced taint lattices.
