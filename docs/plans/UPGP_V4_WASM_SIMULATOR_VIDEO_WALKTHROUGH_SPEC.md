**Document ID**: XORAS-SPEC-031

**Target Output**: 1080p 60fps High-Impact Technical Video & Storyboard Asset  
**Status**: APPROVED & CODIFIED

## 1. Executive Summary & Objective

This specification details the 90-second technical video walkthrough for the **UPGP v4.0 Ultra WebAssembly (WASM) Simulator**, hosted live on GitHub Pages ([`https://aoxendine3.github.io/upgp-proving-ground/`](https://aoxendine3.github.io/upgp-proving-ground/)).

The video demonstrates four un-mocked interactive capabilities running natively inside the browser via `upgp_simulator.wasm`:
1. **16,000 MTPO Concurrency Write Collision Simulation**: Live lock-free HexCell atomic double-buffering.
2. **Saga Inverse Compensation State Machine**: Real-time deterministic rollback down the Merkle DAG lineage upon synthetic fault injection.
3. **HexCell Memory Layout & 128-Byte Cache Alignment**: Visual inspection of `0x3000` Context Bridge and `0x4000` Quarantine Ledger memory regions.
4. **Adversarial Bit-Flip & Anti-Replay Attestation**: Single bit-flip state mutation triggering immediate WASM `[CORRUPTED]` status mutation.

## 2. Storyboard Sequence & Script (90 Seconds)

### Scene 1: Bare-Metal WebAssembly Architecture (0:00 - 0:20)
* **Visual**: High-tech split-screen showing `index.html` loading `assets/wasm/upgp_simulator.wasm` (220 KB compiled Rust binary) alongside Chrome DevTools WebAssembly Memory Inspector.
* **Audio Voiceover (Maxx - Lead Architect)**:
  > "Welcome to the UPGP v4.0 Ultra Proving Ground. What you are looking at is not a static webpage or a server mock—it is a live, compiled Rust WebAssembly kernel running directly inside your browser."

---

### Scene 2: 16,000 MTPO Concurrency & Lock-Free HexCell (0:20 - 0:45)
* **Visual**: Cursor slides MTPO Thread count from 1 to 16,000. Interactive Canvas gauge visualizes write throughput reaching 290k+ ops/sec with zero lock stalls.
* **Audio Voiceover (DAXX - Master Engineer)**:
  > "Watch as we scale MTPO write contenders to 16,000 parallel nodes. Notice how atomic double-buffering across the 6-fold HexCell topology maintains 290,000 operations per second with zero thread blocking."

---

### Scene 3: Synthetic Fault & Saga Inverse Rollback (0:45 - 1:05)
* **Visual**: User clicks 'Trigger Fault Ingestion'. The state machine halts and animates step-by-step inverse compensation steps down the Merkle DAG node lineage, returning state to baseline without state pollution.
* **Audio Voiceover (Clara - Clinical Precision Lead)**:
  > "When a system failure occurs, our Saga inverse compensation engine steps backward through the Merkle DAG lineage, restoring pristine operational state without leaving a single byte of state pollution."

---

### Scene 4: Adversarial Bit-Flip Falsification (1:05 - 1:30)
* **Visual**: User toggles 'Mutate Signature Bit'. The live WASM HMAC-SHA256 engine catches the single-bit corruption instantly, changing the badge from `[SECURE]` to `[CORRUPTED]` with invalid signature alerts.
* **Audio Voiceover (Vance - Falsification Lead)**:
  > "Finally, we flip one single bit in the attestation payload. The WebAssembly engine catches the discrepancy in real time, throwing an immediate corrupted alert. No server, no proxies—just raw mathematical proof."
