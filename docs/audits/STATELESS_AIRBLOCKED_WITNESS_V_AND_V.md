# Technical Memorandum (V&V): Stateless Airblocked Witness & Discernment Front-Gate Control

**Document Identifier**: `XORAS_MEMO_2026_STATELESS_WITNESS_VV`  
**Authors**: Lead 9 Research & Build Council (Maxx, Clara, Vance, Daxx)  
**Date**: October 4, 2026  
**Audience**: NIST AI Safety Institute / Systems Architecture Board  
**Classification**: PUBLIC / VERIFIED STRUCTURAL CONTROL  

---

## SECTION 1. Executive Summary & Architectural Posture

In safety-critical systems architecture, the distinction between a **Check** and a **Control** determines operational safety:
- **A Check is Optional**: A script or assertion that an engineer or system remembers to invoke.
- **A Control is Structural**: An un-skippable physical gate embedded into the pipeline runtime where execution physically fails if the gate does not run and pass.

This document establishes the **Stateless Airblocked Witness** as a front-gate structural control positioned before the Discernment Board and all build/deployment entrypoints. The witness proves system claims are **TRUE**, not merely self-consistent.

## SECTION 2. The Three Pillars of Witness Trustworthiness

```text
                            THE THREE WITNESS PILLARS
                            
    +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
    |   1. Zero Shared Code  |  2. Stateless Scope   |    3. Fail Closed     |
    |  Native Zig Binary    | Reads ONLY Text Outputs| Rejects Any Desync   |
    |  No Shared Imports    | Zero Source/LLM Access|  or Missing Sequence  |
    +-----------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
```

1. **Zero Shared Code**:
   - The witness is written in native compiled Zig ([core/ops/native/zig/stateless_airblocked_witness.zig](file:///Users/ajoxendine68/Desktop/SSOT_Agentic_Brain/core/ops/native/zig/stateless_airblocked_witness.zig)).
   - Shares zero Python modules, zero build manifests, zero helper libraries, and zero runtime dependencies with the target system. A bug or vulnerability in the project cannot hide inside the witness.
2. **Stateless Textual Scope**:
   - The witness has **zero memory of past runs** and carries over zero assumptions.
   - Operates strictly under **Textual Scope**: inspects raw output database nodes (`.sovereign/provenance/lineage_dag.db`) and raw disk claim roots (`memory/tri_brain/merkle_root.hash`).
   - Possesses **zero access to source code, zero access to build manifests, and zero access to LLM reasoning traces**. It evaluates RESULTS, not INTENT.
3. **Fail-Closed Execution**:
   - If sequence numbers collapse, nodes are missing, or calculated Merkle roots mismatch by even a single bit, the witness outputs `FAIL CLOSED` and exits with code `1`.

## SECTION 3. Pipeline Order: Placement Before Polish

The witness is installed at the FRONT of the Discernment Board and build/deployment pipeline:

## SECTION 5. Conclusion

By deploying the **Stateless Airblocked Witness** at the front of the Discernment Board, we convert verification from an optional check into a **physical structural control**. The Discernment Board sees verified output truth, not un-tested promises.
