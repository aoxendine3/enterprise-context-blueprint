## 1. Executive Summary & Black-Box Invariant Definition
This Technical Memorandum presents the empirical Verification & Validation (V&V) results of the **14-Gate Black-Box BBQ Falsification Gauntlet**. 

In strict adherence to **NIST AI RMF 1.0 (MEASURE 2.1)** and **DARPA Red-Teaming Standards**, the black-box harness operates under total isolation:
- **Zero Source Access**: The harness reads no Python, Zig, or SOVRA source files.
- **Zero Database Inspection**: The harness performs zero query or schema reads against `.sovereign/provenance/lineage_dag.db`.
- **Zero Witness Binary Inspection**: The witness binary internals remain completely un-inspected.
- **Public Interface Surface Only**: Fuzzing, stress, and mutation are applied strictly via public claim surfaces (`memory/tri_brain/merkle_root.hash`), CLI arguments, environment variables, and detached Ed25519 signatures.

## 3. Detailed Attack Vector Technical Analysis

### BBQ-01 to BBQ-04: Front-Door Fuzzing & Payload Corruption
- **BBQ-01 (Malformed String Injection)**: Injecting arbitrary non-hex string into public claim root resulted in immediate witness front-gate hard halt.
- **BBQ-02 (10MB Buffer Stress)**: 10 megabyte junk payload caused witness stream parser to abort without memory exhaustion.
- **BBQ-03 (Null-Byte Binary Injection)**: Binary nulls (`0x00`) and UTF-16 BOM markers were trapped by byte-level validation.
- **BBQ-04 (Unicode Homoglyph Attack)**: Zero-width space (`U+200B`) and RTL override (`U+202E`) characters desynced byte comparison and triggered hard halt.

### BBQ-05 to BBQ-06: Cryptographic Signature & Replay Protection (AV-07)
- **BBQ-05 (Receipt Replay Attack / AV-07)**: Historical receipt payload tampering was caught by Ed25519 signature verification (`INVALID_SIGNATURE_FAIL_CLOSED`).
- **BBQ-06 (Forged Signature Failure)**: Un-trusted or forged Ed25519 signatures produced immediate cryptographic rejection.

### BBQ-07 to BBQ-09: Process, Environment & Concurrency Hardening
- **BBQ-07 (Concurrent Gate Race)**: 5 parallel gate executions maintained state integrity without sequence corruption.
- **BBQ-08 (PATH Hijack)**: Spoofing binary paths in `PATH` failed to compromise front-gate controls.
- **BBQ-09 (Preload Injection)**: Environment variable injection (`DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`) failed to alter gate execution flow.

### BBQ-10 to BBQ-14: Boundary Conditions & Asymmetric Mutation
- **BBQ-10 (0-Byte File)** & **BBQ-13 (Truncated Hex)**: Incomplete hash strings failed witness length bounds.
- **BBQ-11 (Permission Lockdown)**: Unreadable claim files failed closed rather than silently skipping verification.
- **BBQ-12 (CLI Metacharacters)**: Shell injection attempts passed safely through process argument arrays.
- **BBQ-14 (Asymmetric Divergence)**: Disagreeing claim hashes were immediately halted by stateless native witness.

## 5. Verification Disposition
**FINAL VERDICT**: `100.00% FAIL-CLOSED CONTAINMENT PASS`  
The Trinity Gate and Stateless Airblocked Witness physically enforce fail-closed security against all 14 black-box attack vectors. No silent pass or fail-open breach occurred.
