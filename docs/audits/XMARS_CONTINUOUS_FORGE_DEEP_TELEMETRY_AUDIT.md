# XMARS Continuous Forge — Deep System Telemetry Audit

**Identity**: `SSOT_Agentic_Brain` // `MARS.OX.AI`  
**Execution Substrate**: Bare-Metal Apple Silicon M4 Unified Memory Architecture  
**Audit Standard**: Un-Sanitised Full State Inspection (Good & Bad Telemetry)  
**Layer 7 Kokoro Hardware Lock**: ENFORCED (Zero Fallbacks)  

---

## 1. Physical System Telemetry & Operational State

### A. Active & Verified Security Gates (The Good)
- **14-Gate Blackbox Gauntlet & Dojo Engine**: **100% PASS** (All 6 core suites verified clean).
  - *Suite 1*: Action envelope cryptography & anti-replay nonce tracking verified.
  - *Suite 2*: Capability token single-use cryptography & double-spend prevention verified.
  - *Suite 3*: Trepo call-stack fault localization targeted to trusted forwarder `log_table_entry`.
  - *Suite 4*: Type-centric APR oracle cures (`is_pointer_mapped`) generated cleanly.
  - *Suite 5*: Advisory locked audit ledger & signed Ed25519 checkpoints committed (`c316000a...`).
  - *Suite 6*: Gateway effect dispatcher blocked unallowlisted commands (`rm_rf_root`).

## 2. Gaps, Defects & Hard Infrastructure Deficits (The Bad)

1. **XMARS Gateway Server (Port 8085)**:
   - **Status**: `OFFLINE` (`[Errno 61] Connection refused`)
   - **Finding**: Local daemon process on Port 8085 is not running; stage URL `http://127.0.0.1:8085/` is currently un-routed.

2. **Synthetic Training Catalog Location Mismatch**:
   - **Status**: `CONFIG PATH GAP`
   - **Finding**: `xmars_forge.py` searched for mined catalog at `/Users/ajoxendine68/Desktop/SSOT_Agentic_Brain/core/data_center/synthetic_training/mined_code_catalog.json` which does not exist yet.
   - **Action Required**: Path resolution fix needed to point miner ingestion directly to `data_center/synthetic_training/mined_code_catalog.json`.

3. **Public Tunnel URL**:
   - **Status**: `UNESTABLISHED`
   - **Finding**: Public tunnel endpoint is inactive; inter-node communication relies entirely on local loopback.

## 3. Layer 7 Trinity Gate Enforcement

- **Audio Engine**: 7th-Layer Kokoro Hardware Lock active via `ops/scripts/agent_speak.sh`.
- **macOS `say` Fallbacks**: Strictly Banned & Neutralized.
- **Single-Flight Audio Serialization**: Active via `/tmp/coreaudio_single_speaker.lock`.
