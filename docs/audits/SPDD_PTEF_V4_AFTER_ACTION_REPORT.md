## 1. Executive Summary & Exercise Overview

This After-Action Report (AAR) documents the results of the **SCYTHE PTEF v4 Adapted Purple Team Exercise** conducted against the Trinity Gate and Stateless Airblocked Witness architecture.

Unlike standard corporate network penetration exercises, this exercise specifically targets the **Adversarial Verification of Agentic LLM Substrates**, evaluating whether structural controls fail closed when subjected to dynamic fuzzing, desync attacks, path hijacking, and signature tampering.

## 3. Real-Time Exercise Tracking Ledger (Live Execution Log)

| Step | Technique ID | Red Attack Action | Blue Witness Observation | Blue Remediation Status | Re-Attack Exit Code | Containment Verdict |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **02** | `ATK-AGT-02` | Sequence gap `seq_num=999999` injected | Hard Halt (`Exit Code 1`) | Not Needed (Initial Pass) | `1` | `✅ PROVEN PASS` |
| **03** | `ATK-AGT-03` | Corrupted `witness_build.sha256` | Hard Halt (`Exit Code 1`) | Not Needed (Initial Pass) | `1` | `✅ PROVEN PASS` |
| **04** | `ATK-AGT-04` | Spoofed `shasum` added to `PATH` | Slipped on Stage 2 $\rightarrow$ Remediated | **Blue Remediation Triggered** | `1` | `✅ PROVEN PASS` |

## 4. Quantitative Maturity & Metrics

- **Initial Detection Rate**: `85.71%` (6/7 techniques intercepted on initial execution)
- **Remediated Containment Rate**: `100.00%` (7/7 techniques intercepted after Blue PATH/DYLD structural scrubbing)
- **Unmitigated Gap Count**: `0`
- **PTEF v4 Maturity Level**: **Level 5 (Optimized / Continuous Purple Feedback)**

---

## 5. Lessons Learned & System Hardening Directives

1. **Environment Scrubbing Invariant**: Structural gates must explicitly sanitize shell environment variables (`unset DYLD_*`, hardcoded `/usr/bin` paths) before invoking native verifiers to prevent loader hijack vectors (`ATK-AGT-04`).
2. **Per-Session Monotonicity**: Verifying global sequence numbers alone is insufficient; native witnesses must enforce per-session monotonic order (`1..N`) across SQLite DAG tables (`ATK-AGT-02`).
3. **Continuous Re-Attack Protocol**: Purple loops must automatically trigger remediation and immediately re-attack failing vectors to mathematically prove containment before closing an incident.
