## 1. Government & Enterprise Security Compliance Mapping

UPGP v4.0 Ultra is engineered to comply with major government, federal, and enterprise cybersecurity control frameworks:

| Compliance Framework | Control Reference | UPGP v4.0 Ultra Implementation & Assurance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5** | **SA-11** (Developer Security Testing) | Un-mocked automated unit & side-channel gauntlet (`tests/UPGPProvingGround.test.ts`) |
| **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5** | **SC-13** (Cryptographic Protection) | Native FIPS-compliant cryptographic primitives (AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2, HKDF-SHA256) |
| **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5** | **SC-28** (Protection of Information at Rest) | AES-256-GCM encrypted local fallback seal (`.upgp-seal`) with 16-byte IV & AuthTag |
| **FIPS 140-3** | **Module Security Requirements** | High-entropy PBKDF2 key expansion (10,000+ iterations) and secure key memory zeroing (`.fill(0)`) |
| **Common Criteria EAL4+** | **ADV_IMP.1** (Implementation Representation) | Microtask Interleave Masking (MIM), constant-time BFT consensus padding, zero raw SHM heap pointer leaks |
| **ISO/IEC 27001:2022** | **Control A.8.24** (Use of Cryptography) | Platform-derived PBKDF2/HKDF silicon locks combined with Hardware UUID verification |
| **SOC 2 Type II** | **CC6.1** (Logical Access & Boundary Controls) | Seccomp-BPF Linux syscall profiles blocking `ptrace`, `kexec_load`, `unshare`, and dynamic `eval` |
| **HIPAA / HITECH** | **164.312(a)(2)(iv)** (Encryption & Decryption) | 100% air-gapped local browser and Node execution with zero remote network calls |

## 2. Microarchitectural Isolation & Environment Guidelines

To maintain true statistical timing indistinguishability during benchmarks:

1. **Network Air-Gap**: Testing must be performed strictly offline. Outbound network socket calls and DNS lookups introduce external variance that distorts cumulative distribution curves.
2. **CPU Core Affinity (Core-Pinning)**: To prevent OS scheduler context switches from skewing thread timing, pin the test process to a single dedicated core:
   ```bash
   taskset -c 2 npm test
   ```
3. **Memory Sanitation & Zero-Trace Guarantee**: All plaintext key material and intermediate signature buffers are explicitly scrubbed from heap memory (`buffer.fill(0)`) immediately after execution.
